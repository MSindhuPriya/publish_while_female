Exploring gender bias in peer review

# Overall
This paper aims to create an analysis on discrimination with the publishing of scholarly papers. An original research was made by Erin Hengel and we aim to further investigate this by using the data provided with her study. Hengel's paper focuses on the gender biases while we aim to see if there exists bias with native and non-native English speakers as well.
